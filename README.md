# CrowdTLL
Crowd sourced traffic light control for outreach events.
*Please acknowledge the author in any derivative works.*

## Description
A simple crossroads simulated using the [TraCI](http://sumo.dlr.de/wiki/TraCI) [Python](https://www.python.org/) API to the [SUMO](http://www.sumo.dlr.de/) microsimulator.

The program maps the keyboard arrow keys to control the direction of the traffic flow using the [Pynput](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pynput) Python library.

The background overlay was created using [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/), art credits below.

Given the intention of displaying this to a wide audience, the vehicels are colored in a color blind accessible color palette.

## Future work:
- Log user data so that machine learning can be applied to good user scores.
- Create a leader board so that users at events can see how they compare.
- Simulation reloads automatically.
